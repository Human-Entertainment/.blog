Apple quietly added a feature to iTunes/App Store purchasing recently: the ability to add an Apple Pay card to your purchase account. Yes, a major feature is finally here. Friend of my [discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/guT6tf8) user name Bunker has shared their discovery. *update* This feature appears to be beta only, and will release with iOS 12.3. In the meantime, make sure you have Apple Pay set up.

First, open settings on your iOS device:

From here you will be shown the option of adding a card from your Apple Pay wallet.

That is it! Glad that Apple finally gave us this much requested option. For more Apple news and commentary follow me at [my twitter](http://twitter.com/hillitech).
