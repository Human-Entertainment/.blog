# Sorry for the mess
    
We are currently migrating our blog to Sundell's [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) from [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). There is no beef between us and Ghost, we just felt constrained, and Publish allows us to do absolutely everything we want. This added flexibility is why we went with Publish, as and added bonus, we also now have all our blog posts as raw markdown files.

Currently our website doesn't look ideal, and everything will change slowly. In the meanwhile thank you for your patience and understanging.

If you see any anormalities from our earlier posts, please don't hesitate to reach out to Bastian on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BastianInuk).
