Elgato announced earlier today that, amongst their [new Android app](https://twitter.com/elgatogaming/status/1237407940471959552?s=20), the iOS app now supports Siri Shortcuts.

This means, people who have iPhones, and pay for the 25,- monthly sub, can now automate their computers.

Setting the shortcuts up with the streamdeck app is easy. 

- First step is to ensure that the desktop app is on version 4.6 and the mobile app is on 1.1, otherwise the system will not be able to be set up.
- Once this is ensured, there's going to be a microphone button in one of the corners, press this.
