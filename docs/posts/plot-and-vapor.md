[John Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com) has released his DSL for HTML written Swift [Plot](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot). You may have wondered "how do I make it work with Vapor?" as did I, when I found [this article](https://medium.com/@andreabellotto88/how-to-use-plot-in-vapor-3-0-404316ce24c0) telling how to make this work. The article is written for Vapor 3 and I want to focus on Vapor 4.

For beginner we need to make sure that we can even use Plot, to to this, add Plot to you Package.swift:
```swift
    let package = Package(
      name: "Manga",	
      dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(url: "https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot.git", from: "0.5.0")
        ...	
      ],
      targets: [
        .target(name: "App", dependencies: [
        	...
        	"Plot",
        	...
      	]),
      ...
      ]
    )
```    

You can now begin using Plot when you pulled in your packages. The clever and impatient might notic that `func myRouter(req:) throws -> EventLoopFuture<HTML>` is going throwing compile errors, so to support the `EventLoopFuture<HTML>` we need to extend `HTML` and add two functions like so:

```swift
    import Plot
    import Vapor
    
    extension HTML: ResponseEncodable {
            public func encodeResponse(for request: Request) -> EventLoopFuture<HTML> {
            request.eventLoop.submit{self}
        }
        
        public func encodeResponse(for req: Request) -> EventLoopFuture<Response> {
            let res = Response(headers: ["content-type": "text/html; charset=utf-8"], body: .init(string: self.render()))
            return res.encodeResponse(for: req)
        }
    }
```    

The first functions allows us to easily write a route that looks a little something like, and omit the `.render()` as that'be handled by the eventloop.

```swift
    func myRoute(req: Request) throws -> EventLoopFuture<HTML> {
        HTML(.body(.p("Hello World!"))).encodeResponse(for: req)
    }
```

But without the latter function, we can't conform to `ResponseEncodable` which is important for the `EventLoopFuture`. The function also handles rendering the HTML for us, so we don't have to. And now you've added this extension, you can use Â Plot as much as you want in Vapor 4, just remember to chain `.encodeResponse(req)`!
