I may make a bold assumption in that most of my readers are students. And I can tell you that a bunch of my fellow students at my university don't actually know about this offer that GitHub has, so let me just mention it real quick. GitHub has partnered with a large number of companies, some of which already offers stuff to student like JetBrains, others does it exclusively through GitHub. Most if not all of these offers are unfortunately tech related, so that limits the appeal, but it's free, quick and easy to sign up to GitHub Studentpack and you get a bunch of great stuff from it, so check it out over at [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack)!
