Couch co-op sucks. No seriously, first off if a pair shares a Switch, they also share an island in AC:NH. When they want to play together, one player has to be leader and the other follower, the folower has no freedom what so ever; depending on who you're playing with, you get to swap who's leader and who's follower by shaking the joy-cons. There's nothing for the follower to do, but aid the leader in their daily endeavours. The aid can be hitting rocks or catching bugs and the like, issue is the follower doesn't get an item beyon tools, so everything they gather ends in the recycle bin for the leader to grab.

I really like AC:NH, I got 45 hours registered, but man couch co-op sucks.
